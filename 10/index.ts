// Adding Comments: Choose two of the programs you’ve written, and add at least one comment to each. If you don’t have anything specific to write because your programs are too simple at this point, just add your name and the current date at the top of each program file. Then write one sentence describing what the program does.

// This is assignment 6 below:

// // Stripping Names: Store a person’s name, and include some whitespace characters at the beginning 
// // and end of the name. Make sure you use each character combination, "\t" and "\n", at least once. 
// // Print the name once, so the whitespace around the name is displayed. Then print the name after striping
// // the white spaces.

/*let firstName : string = `\t   Umar Jan  \n`

console.log(`WhiteSpace :` , firstName)


let trimName : string = firstName.trim()

console.log(`Stripped :` , trimName) */

// done

// actual code is in line 10-17 and do not change it.
// line 10-17 is seperatley commented out.
// Thank you.

console.log(`this is exercise just on "how to do comments", and there are 3 ways to comment`)
